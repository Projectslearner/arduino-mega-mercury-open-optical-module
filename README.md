# Mercury Open Optical Module

#### Project Overview

The **Mercury Open Optical Module** project utilizes an optical sensor module with an Arduino Mega to detect the presence of an object in its optical path. Optical sensors like this are commonly used in various applications such as object detection, counting systems, and automation.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Mercury Open Optical Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Mercury Open Optical Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin**: Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Mega.
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Mercury Open Optical Module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for readings:
     - **Object detected in the optical path:** Indicates that the sensor has detected an object (output is HIGH).
     - **No object detected in the optical path:** Indicates that no object is detected (output is LOW).

#### Applications

- **Object Detection:** Trigger actions based on the presence or absence of objects in a specific area.
- **Counting Systems:** Count objects passing through a specific point.
- **Automation:** Integrate with robotic systems for object handling and positioning.

#### Notes

- Ensure the optical sensor is positioned correctly to detect objects as intended.
- Adjust the sensor's sensitivity or detection range based on your specific application requirements.
- Consider ambient light conditions and other environmental factors that may affect sensor performance.
